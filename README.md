# Minesweeper-Solver
This is a personal project I've been wanting to work on for a while. After playing minesweeper a few times, I realized that the way you solve it is very repetitive and robotic; at least for solving the squares that don't take chance. I decided I really want to write this algorithm so I first downloaded a minesweeper script I found online to get started, then I will make some changes outlined below...

## Minesweeper V2
Before getting to writing my solving algorithm, I noticed some problems with the original minesweeper script that I wanted to change so I made a copy called minesweeper_v2 and will be fixing up this copy. After fixing the copy, I will proceed to integrating into it with...

## Solving Algorithm
After finishing v2, I will write my own code into v2 to basically sink my "tentacles" into the game's code and hook my algorithm onto components of the game it will need to interact with. That is all I have planned for now and will continue to update this once I have more.
