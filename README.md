# Minesweeper-Solver
**Minesweeper-Solver** is a never-ending project dedicated to building the most near perfect Minesweeper bot. Minesweeper is a game of numbers and the first 80% of it can be figured out definitively with some basic calculations. The real challenge comes with the last bit of the game where those simple calculations don't work anymore and you're left with a game of mostly chance. My goal is to continuously add to and improve a combination of algorithms to reduce this uncertainty as much as possible. Eventually I will end up with a Minesweeper bot that's near perfect at playing the game and I no longer have to tap and pray to finish off the board.
