# Minesweeper-Solver
This is a personal project I've been wanting to work on for a while. After playing minesweeper a few times, I realized that the way you solve it is very repetitive and robotic; at least for solving the squares that don't take chance. I decided I really want to write this algorithm so I first I worked on building minesweeper from scratch, to then be able to write the solving part of the game. **Currently I've finished the game and starting to figure out the solver. The game works phenomaly and looks beautiful.**

## To Play
To play, all you need to do is run minesweeper_oop.py and follow the instructions. **Enjoy!**
