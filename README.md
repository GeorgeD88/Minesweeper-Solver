# Minesweeper-Solver
**Minesweeper-Solver** is a personal project I'm very passionate about that I don't think I will ever truly finish developing
*I SHOULD JUST DESCRIBE THIS AS NEVER NOT CHANGING PROJECT ON A QUEST TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE MINESWEEPER AND THEN SPLIT THE WHOLE BACKSTORY INTO A SEPARATE INTRO. THE CAPTION UNDER THE TITLE SHOULD JUST BE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT, NOT A WHOLE BACKSTORY.*

## Intro/backstory (FIGURE IT OUT LATER)
I'm very passionate about that I don't think I will ever truly finish developing due to the vast complexity ~~of solving Minesweeper.~~ After playing minesweeper a few times, I realized that the first 90% of the board is solved by applying a very simple algorithm over and over again. I quickly took the chance and developed my own Minesweeper from scratch to then create a solver with the basic algorithm I discovered. What I didn't realize at the time though, is that I would become completely obsessed with figuring out how to solve the last 10% of the board, the part that BANKED on probability. This is because when you search the web for algorithms to solve the game, you realize there are no definite ways of solving that last bit due to the unpredictable randomness of it. *FROM THAT* I was determined to get as close to definitely solving the game as possible. *The way I planned on tackling this daunting challenge was by first finding and studying as many existing algorithms on solving the game and then using them to determine which are the few most efficient as well developing my own.* *<-- REVISE THAT* My goal is to keep revising the algorithms I've implemented or developed myself to continuously get closer to a near perfect Minesweeper solver. This will, most likely, be a never ending process as I don't think there's a way to perfectly solve Minesweeper; at least I'm pretty sure there isn't because there are plenty of smart people than me that would've discovered it already. *TRANSITION IT OFF*

## To Play
To play, all you need to do is run minesweeper_oop.py and follow the instructions. **Enjoy!**

Introduction
Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, a complete implementation of the IEEE POSIX and Open Group shell specification with interactive command line editing, job control on architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. Here is a short list of some of the features available in bash.

For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this type of shell, see the reference manual. There is also a large Unix-style man page. The man page is the definitive description of the shell's features.

Bash is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3.

A number of frequently-asked questions are answered in the FAQ, though that is no longer maintained.
