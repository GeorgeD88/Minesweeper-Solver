# Minesweeper-Solver
**Minesweeper-Solver** is a never-ending project dedicated to building the most near perfect Minesweeper bot. Minesweeper is a game of numbers and the first 80% of it can be figured out definitively with some basic calculations. The real challenge comes with the last bit of the game where those simple calculations don't work anymore and you're left with a game of mostly chance. My goal is to continuously add to and improve a combination of algorithms to reduce this uncertainty as much as possible. Eventually I will end up with a Minesweeper bot that's near perfect at playing the game and I no longer have to tap and pray to finish off the board.
## To Play
To play, all you need to do is run minesweeper_oop.py and follow the instructions. **Enjoy!**

Introduction
Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, a complete implementation of the IEEE POSIX and Open Group shell specification with interactive command line editing, job control on architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. Here is a short list of some of the features available in bash.

For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this type of shell, see the reference manual. There is also a large Unix-style man page. The man page is the definitive description of the shell's features.

Bash is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3.

A number of frequently-asked questions are answered in the FAQ, though that is no longer maintained.
